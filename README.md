# Actea – Act on Your Idea

Actea is a social media platform designed to connect those with the vision for new ideas with others who are passionate about their cause. The platform was built for university students with the drive to create a product that resonates with a stable target market. They can collaborate on things like software, hobby clubs, social impact or even make video game teams. By allowing a community to come together, this platform empowers high achieving students to not only study but make a difference.
